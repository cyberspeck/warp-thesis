abstract = {Magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) image fusion with CT-based dose calculation is the gold standard for prostate treatment planning. MR and CT fusion with CT-based dose calculation has become a routine procedure for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment planning at Fox Chase Cancer Center. The use of MRI alone for treatment planning (or MRI simulation) will remove any errors associated with image fusion. Furthermore, it will reduce treatment cost by avoiding redundant CT scans and save patient, staff, and machine time. The purpose of this study is to investigate the dosimetric accuracy of MRI-based treatment planning for prostate IMRT. A total of 30 IMRT plans for 15 patients were generated using both MRI and CT data. The MRI distortion was corrected using gradient distortion correction (GDC) software provided by the vendor (Philips Medical System, Cleveland, OH). The same internal contours were used for the paired plans. The external contours were drawn separately between CT-based and MR imaging-based plans to evaluate the effect of any residual distortions on dosimetric accuracy. The same energy, beam angles, dose constrains, and optimization parameters were used for dose calculations for each paired plans using a treatment optimization system. The resulting plans were compared in terms of isodose distributions and dose-volume histograms (DVHs). Hybrid phantom plans were generated for both the CT-based plans and the MR-based plans using the same leaf sequences and associated monitor units (MU). The physical phantom was then irradiated using the same leaf sequences to verify the dosimetry accuracy of the treatment plans. Our results show that dose distributions between CT-based and MRI-based plans were equally acceptable based on our clinical criteria. The absolute dose agreement for the planning target volume was within 2{\{}{\%}{\}} between CT-based and MR-based plans and 3{\{}{\%}{\}} between measured dose and dose predicted by the planning system in the physical phantom. Magnetic resonnace imaging is a useful tool for radiotherapy simulation. Compared with CT-based treatment planning, MR imaging-based treatment planning meets the accuracy for dose calculation and provides consistent treatment plans for prostate IMRT. Because MR imaging-based digitally reconstructed radiographs do not provide adequate bony structure information, a technique is suggested for producing a wire-frame image that is intended to replace the traditional digitally reconstructed radiographs that are made from CT information. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.},

The chemical name for disodium gadoxetate is (4S)-4-(4-ethoxybenzyl)-3,6,9-triazaundecanedioic acid, gadolinium-complex, disodium salt and has the following chemical structure: The physico-chemical properties of Primovist are listed below: Osmolality at 37°C (mOsm/kg H2O) 688 Density at 37°C (g/mL) 1.0881 Viscosity at 37°C (mPa{\textperiodcentered}s) 1.19 pH 6.8 – 8.0 DESCRIPTION Primovist is presented as a solution for injection. Each 1 mL of the MRI contrast agent Primovist contains 0.25 mmol disodium gadoxetate (equivalent to 181.43 mg disodium gadoxetate as the active ingredient). The excipients 2 are: trisodium caloxetate, trometamol, hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment), sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment) and water for injections. Each mL contains 0.511 mmol (equivalent to 11.755 mg) of sodium (See Precautions). Primovist contains no antimicrobial preservative. Pharmacology Pharmacodynamic properties Primovist is a paramagnetic contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging. The contrast-enhancing effect is mediated by gadoxetate, an ionic complex consisting of gadolinium (III) and the ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid which contains the lipophilic ethoxybenzyl moiety (Gd-EOB-DTPA). When T1-weighted scanning sequences are used in proton magnetic resonance imaging, the gadolinium ion-induced shortening of the spin-lattice relaxation time of excited atomic nuclei leads to an increase of the signal intensity and, hence, to an increase of the image contrast of certain tissues.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Accurate geometry is required for radiotherapy treatment planning (RTP). When considering the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for RTP, geometric distortions observed in the acquired images should be considered. While scanner technology and vendor supplied correction algorithms provide some correction, large distortions are still present in images, even when considering considerably smaller scan lengths than those typically acquired with CT in conventional RTP. This study investigates MRI acquisition with a moving table compared with static scans for potential geometric benefits for RTP.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nMETHODS: A full field of view (FOV) phantom (diameter 500 mm; length 513 mm) was developed for measuring geometric distortions in MR images over volumes pertinent to RTP. The phantom consisted of layers of refined plastic within which vitamin E capsules were inserted. The phantom was scanned on CT to provide the geometric gold standard and on MRI, with differences in capsule location determining the distortion. MRI images were acquired with two techniques. For the first method, standard static table acquisitions were considered. Both 2D and 3D acquisition techniques were investigated. With the second technique, images were acquired with a moving table. The same sequence was acquired with a static table and then with table speeds of 1.1 mm/s and 2 mm/s. All of the MR images acquired were registered to the CT dataset using a deformable B-spline registration with the resulting deformation fields providing the distortion information for each acquisition.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nRESULTS: MR images acquired with the moving table enabled imaging of the whole phantom length while images acquired with a static table were only able to image 50{\{}{\%}{\}}-70{\{}{\%}{\}} of the phantom length of 513 mm. Maximum distortion values were reduced across a larger volume when imaging with a moving table. Increased table speed resulted in a larger contribution of distortion from gradient nonlinearities in the through-plane direction and an increased blurring of capsule images, resulting in an apparent capsule volume increase by up to 170{\{}{\%}{\}} in extreme axial FOV regions. Blurring increased with table speed and in the central regions of the phantom, geometric distortion was less for static table acquisitions compared to a table speed of 2 mm/s over the same volume. Overall, the best geometric accuracy was achieved with a table speed of 1.1 mm/s.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nCONCLUSIONS: The phantom designed enables full FOV imaging for distortion assessment for the purposes of RTP. MRI acquisition with a moving table extends the imaging volume in the z direction with reduced distortions which could be useful particularly if considering MR-only planning. If utilizing MR images to provide additional soft tissue information to the planning CT, standard acquisition sequences over a smaller volume would avoid introducing additional blurring or distortions from the through-plane table movement.},

abstract = {Background and purpose: Image distortion is one of the major drawbacks of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for use in radiotherapy treatment planning (RTTP). In this study, the reproducibility of MR imaging distortion was evaluated by repeated phantom measurements. Materials and methods: A grid-pattern acrylic phantom was scanned with a 0.2-Tesla permanent magnetic unit. We repeated a series of scans three times to evaluate the reproducibility of the distortion. In each series, co-ordinates at 432 intersections of the grid were measured for both T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo (SE) pulse sequences. Positional displacements and their variations at the intersections were calculated. Results: Averages of the displacements were distributed between 1.58 and 1.74 mm, and maximum values (MAX) between 12.6 and 15.0 mm. Within 120 mm of the image center, the average values ranged from 0.73 to 0.80 mm, and from 3.4 to 5.0 mm for MAX. The absolute values of the positional variations among three series were distributed between 0.41 and 0.88 mm for average values, and between 1.4 and 4.5 mm for MAX. Conclusions: The positional variations were mostly within 3 pixels, and most of the positional displacements within the radius of 120 mm of the image center were 2 mm or less. Therefore, it will be possible to use this MR system in RTTP under limited situations, although careful applications are required for RTTP of the body. The development of a computer program to correct image distortion is expected. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: Sensitivity and resolution are two main parameters that have to be measured in gel dosimetry. However, the resolution in gel is strongly dependant on gel composition. Selection of optimum method in dose response readout and proper values of parameters can result in noise reduction as well as improvement of contrast, and spatial resolution considerably. Materials and Methods: MAGICA polymer gel dosimeters were manufactured and irradiated to different doses using a 60Co therapy unit. Imaging was performed in a 0.5T MRI with 8 echoes in air and water as a hydrogenous environment. Imaging condition was kept constant, as much as possible, in both imaging modalities. Results: Images obtained from these two procedures were compared quantitatively. R2- dose curves have three different sections, sensitivity obtained in these three sections were 1.039, 1.671, 1.260 Gy-1S-1 and 1.032, 1.729, 1.37 Gy-1S-1 for water and air respectively. Calibration errors were investigated and graphically were compared in two different methods. Conclusion: Imaging in water medium for doses lower than 17 Gy led to a small reduction in spatial resolution was exchanged to a considerable increase of contrast in R2 map. For doses higher than17 Gy, imaging in water or air was preferred depending on the importance of contrast or spatial resolution. Iran.},

This method allows the correction to be made on phantom images acquired without or with the vendor correction applied. With the vendor's 2D correction applied, the method corrects for both the "residual" geometric distortion still present in the plane in which the correction method was applied (the axial plane) and the uncorrected geometric distortion along the axis normal to the plane. The evaluation of the effectiveness of the correction using this new method was carried out through analyzing the residual geometric distortion in the corrected phantom images. The results show that the new method can restore the distorted images in 3D nearly to perfection. For all the MRI systems investigated, the mean absolute deviations in the positions of the control points (along x-, y- and z-axes) measured on the corrected phantom images were all less than 0.2 mm. The maximum absolute deviations were all below ???0.8 mm. As expected, the correction of the phantom images acquired with the vendor's correction applied in the axial plane performed equally well. Both the geometric distortion still present in the axial plane after applying the vendor's correction and the uncorrected distortion along the z-axis have all been "restored." ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Rationale and Objectives: To characterize and compare commer-cially available contrast media (CM) for magnetic resonance imag-ing (MRI) in terms of their relaxivity at magnetic field strengths ranging from 0.47 T to 4.7 T at physiological temperatures in water and in plasma. Relaxivities also were quantified in whole blood at 1.5 T. Methods: Relaxivities of MRI-CM were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy at 0.47 T and MRI phan-tom measurements at 1.5 T, 3 T, and 4.7 T, respectively. Both longitudinal (T 1) and transverse relaxation times (T 2) were mea-sured by appropriate spin-echo sequences. Nuclear magnetic reso-nance dispersion (NMRD) profiles were also determined for all agents in water and in plasma. Results: Significant dependencies of relaxivities on the field strength and solvents were quantified. Protein binding leads to both increased field strength and solvent dependencies and hence to significantly altered T 1 relaxivity values at higher magnetic field strengths. Conclusions: Awareness of the field strength and solvent associated with relaxivity data is crucial for the comparison and evaluation of relaxivity values. Data observed at 0.47 T can thus be misleading and should be replaced by relaxivities measured at 1.5 T and at 3 T in plasma at physiological temperature.},

abstract = {MRI signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is the key factor for image quality. Conventionally, SNR is proportional to nuclear spin polarization, which scales linearly with magnetic field strength. Yet ever-stronger magnets present numerous technical and financial limitations. Low-field MRI can mitigate these constraints with equivalent SNR from non-equilibrium 'hyperpolarization' schemes, which increase polarization by orders of magnitude independently of the magnetic field. Here, theory and experimental validation demonstrate that combination of field independent polarization (e.g. hyperpolarization) with frequency optimized MRI detection coils (i.e. multi-turn coils using the maximum allowed conductor length) results in low-field MRI sensitivity approaching and even rivaling that of high-field MRI. Four read-out frequencies were tested using samples with identical numbers of 1H and 13C spins. Experimental SNRs at 0.0475 T were ???40{\%} of those obtained at 4.7 T. Conservatively, theoretical SNRs at 0.0475 T 1.13-fold higher than those at 4.7 T were possible despite an ???100-fold lower detection frequency, indicating feasibility of high-sensitivity MRI without technically challenging, expensive high-field magnets. The data at 4.7 T and 0.0475 T was obtained from different spectrometers with different RF probes. The SNR comparison between the two field strengths accounted for many differences in parameters such as system noise figures and variations in the probe detection coils including Q factors and coil diameters. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Purpose To test the potential of MRI-based treatment plan simulation for ion radiotherapy in the brain region. Materials and methods A classification-based tissue segmentation method based on discriminant analysis was employed to derive so-called pseudo CT numbers from MR images of three patients with lesions in the head region undergoing ion radiotherapy. Treatment plans for ions, and for comparison purposes also for photons, were subsequently optimized and simulated using both MRI-based pseudo CT and a standard X-ray-based reference CT. Results Pseudo CTs revealed mean absolute errors in CT number in the range of 141-165 HU. While soft tissue was in good agreement with reference CT values, large deviations appeared at air cavities and bones as well as at interfaces of different tissue types. In simulations of ion treatment plans, pseudo CT optimizations showed small underdosages of target volumes with deviations in the PTV mean dose of 0.4-2.0{\%} in comparison to reference CT optimizations. In contrast, the PTV mean dose in photon treatment plans differed by no more than 0.2{\%}. Conclusions The main challenge in deriving pseudo CT numbers from MRI was the correct assignment of air and compact bone. In this study, the impact of deviations on simulations of ion and photon treatment plans in the brain region was small, however for more complicated morphologies a further improvement of the classification method including MR imaging of compact bone is required. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {A phantom that can be used for mapping geometric distortion in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is described. This phantom provides an array of densely distributed control points in three-dimensional (3D) space. These points form the basis of a comprehensive measurement method to correct for geometric distortion in MR images arising principally from gradient field non-linearity and magnet field inhomogeneity. The phantom was designed based on the concept that a point in space can be defined using three orthogonal planes. This novel design approach allows for as many control points as desired. Employing this novel design, a highly accurate method has been developed that enables the positions of the control points to be measured to sub-voxel accuracy. The phantom described in this paper was constructed to fit into a body coil of a MRI scanner, (external dimensions of the phantom were: 310 mm ?? 310 mm ?? 310 mm), and it contained 10,830 control points. With this phantom, the mean errors in the measured coordinates of the control points were on the order of 0.1 mm or less, which were less than one tenth of the voxel's dimensions of the phantom image. The calculated three-dimensional distortion map, i.e., the differences between the image positions and true positions of the control points, can then be used to compensate for geometric distortion for a full image restoration. It is anticipated that this novel method will have an impact on the applicability of MRI in both clinical and research settings, especially in areas where geometric accuracy is highly required, such as in MR neuro-imaging. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE . In light of the rapidly increasing frequency of pediatric CT examinations, the purpose of our study was to assess the lifetime cancer mortality risks attributable to radia-tion from pediatric CT. MATERIALS AND METHODS . Organ doses as a function of age-at-diagnosis were esti-mated for common CT examinations, and estimated attributable lifetime cancer mortality risks (per unit dose) for different organ sites were applied. Standard models that assume a linear ex-trapolation of risks from intermediate to low doses were applied. On the basis of current standard practice, the same exposures (milliampere-seconds) were assumed, independent of age. RESULTS . The larger doses and increased lifetime radiation risks in children produce a sharp increase, relative to adults, in estimated risk from CT. Estimated lifetime cancer mortal-ity risks attributable to the radiation exposure from a CT in a 1-year-old are 0.18{\%} (abdomi-nal) and 0.07{\%} (head)—an order of magnitude higher than for adults—although those figures still represent a small increase in cancer mortality over the natrual background rate. In the United States, of approximately 600,000 abdominal and head CT examinations annually per-formed in children under the age of 15 years, a rough estimate is that 500 of these individuals might ultimately die from cancer attributable to the CT radiation. CONCLUSION . The best available risk estimates suggest that pediatric CT will result in significantly increased lifetime radiation risk over adult CT, both because of the increased dose per milliampere-second, and the increased lifetime risk per unit dose. Lower milliam-pere-second settings can be used for children without significant loss of information. Al-though the risk–benefit balance is still strongly tilted toward benefit, because the frequency of pediatric CT examinations is rapidly increasing, estimates that quantitative lifetime radiation risks for children undergoing CT are not negligible may stimulate more active reduction of CT exposure settings in pediatric patients.},

  abstract = {I. INTRODUCTION The purpose of this document is to suggest and define ele-ments that could constitute an Acceptance Test for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) devices. The emphasis is on dis-cussing the relevance, applicability, and performance of these elements as opposed to suggesting one comprehensive model for testing a generic MRI device. This approach is necessitated by the diversity of devices in the marketplace, as well as the availability of specific test equipment for the test-ing physicist. The document lists individual tests, each with the ratio-nale for the test, a proposed procedure, and suggested accep-tance criteria. In several cases alternative procedures are proposed. The earliest possible involvement of the physicist in the installation process is urged. Ideally, the physicist will be involved in the purchasing decision, construction meetings, and radiofrequency shielding tests. The setting of specifica-tions and the review of the contract should be prime areas of consideration for the physicist. Involvement of the physicist at an early stage allows for much more input into the word-ing of the definitions and testing procedures for evaluating the specifications. The physicist should be able to participate in decisions such as determining the amount of emphasis to be given to clinical images in acceptance testing. The suc-cessful completion of a specific performance evaluation pro-gram should be the only basis for acceptance. Acceptance should not be conditioned on the first patient examination. With an a priori knowledge of the system's capabilities and the test equipment available, tests can be defined for which both the physicist and the MRI system are equipped. These considerations are very important, for example, in de-ciding which of the suggested methods for measuring mag-netic field homogeneity or eddy current compensation would be most appropriate. Also at an early stage of the purchasing process, the physi-cist will be able to work with the vendor to establish which specifications are most important on a given system and how they should be tested. Many perfectly reasonable trade-offs are made during an MRI system's engineering design pro-cess. A classic example is the trade-off between signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and image uniformity inherent to the de-sign of a particular radiofrequency coil. The physicist must take these types of considerations into account when devis-ing specifications appropriate to the individual system under consideration.},

  abstract = {Because the gaps between the plates (of the Defrise phantoms) or holes (in the Hotspot or cold rods in other phantoms) phantoms are small, you may encounter some small bubbles that adhere to the inserts and/or cylinder surfaces. You might find it helps to use a thinner or wetting agent (surfactant) of some kind that will reduce the tendency of small bubbles to adhere to the wall and gaps. A few drops of common dish washing detergent (that is, the kind that is used with automatic dishwashing machines) may be used to minimize this effect. For example, a solution of 1 mL dish washing detergent, (such as Cascade gel) added to 200 mL water may be tried. Also you may try 2 or 3 drops of liquid dish soap such as Ivory or Joy) added to 100 mL of water. This latter solution may produce too many bubbles, if the solution is stirred too vigorously. Be careful not to mix the solution so vigorously that soap bubbles form. Some hand soaps contain a surfactant and a few drops of these kinds of soap, added to 100 mL of water may also be tried. Avoid alcohols, solvents, and even any soaps or detergents that may contain alcohol or solvents of any kind.},

  abstract      = {Computer tomographic (CT) scans are used to correct for tissue inhomogeneities in radiotherapy treatment planning. In order to guarantee a precise treatment, it is important to obtain the relationship between CT Hounsfield units and electron densities (or proton stopping powers for proton radiotherapy), which is the basic input for radiotherapy planning systems which consider tissue heterogeneities. A method is described to determine improved CT calibrations for biological tissue (a stoichiometric calibration) based on measurements using tissue equivalent materials. The precision of this stoichiometric calibration and the more usual tissue substitute calibration is determined by a comparison of calculated proton radiographic images based on these calibrations and measured radiographs of a biological sample. It has been found that the stoichiometric calibration is more precise than the tissue substitute calibration.},

@article{Petersch2004,
abstract = {Background and purpose To evaluate the impact of two different methods of geometric distortion correction of MR images from a Siemens Magnetom Open Viva 0.2T resistive MR unit on the process of external beam radiotherapy treatment planning for prostate cancer. Patients and methods A method for correction of system related and object induced distortions and one for correction of purely system related distortions have been evaluated. The latter used information extracted from MR images of a 3D phantom specifically designed for geometric distortion evaluation. An active shim procedure was performed prior to all phantom and patient scans. For each of five patients five standard treatment plans were compared using uncorrected and corrected MR images alone (density=water) and CT images alone. Finally internal anatomical landmarks were used for image registration between MR images (corrected and uncorrected) and CT images to evaluate the impact of distortion correction on the image registration process. Results Maximum distortions of 28 mm (mean 2.2 mm) were found within the FOV in frequency encode direction. Maximum distortions could be reduced by a factor of two (mean factor four) by our phantom measurement based technique. Distortion patterns were found to be stable and reproducible over several weeks with this MR unit. For 4/5 patients, relative doses at the normalization point as calculated on the distortion corrected MR images only (all tissues taken water equivalent) were all within 1{\%} of the corresponding value from the standard CT-based plan (actual Hounsfield units). The largest differences in isocentric dose found in one case were 3.1{\%} MR uncorrected vs. CT and 2.6{\%} MR corrected vs. CT. Typical sites of internal anatomical landmarks chosen for image registration show distortions up to 3 mm. Conclusions Object induced distortions are negligible at such low field strengths compared to system related distortions. Treatment plans for prostate cancer do not seem to differ significantly from 'standard' plans calculated on CT images when calculated on distortion corrected MR images, even if all tissues are assigned the electron density of water. Distortion correction of MR images can theoretically improve the starting point for image registration of MR and CT images. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Bangard2007,
abstract = {Objective: To evaluate motion artifacts and patient acceptability of MR imaging of claustrophobic patients in an open 1.0 T scanner. Subjects and methods: Thirty six claustrophobic patients were enrolled prospectively, 34 of which had previous MR examinations in closed bore magnets. Anxiety and pain during MR examination in an open 1.0 T scanner were evaluated by visual analogue scales and various tests. Influence of motion artifacts on image quality was evaluated by two radiologists independently using a five-point scale. Additionally, 36 non-claustrophobic patients delivered a reference value of a non-claustrophobic population for the visual analogue anxiety scale. Results: Termination rate of MR imaging of highly claustrophobic patients decreased from 58.3{\%} (n = 21) in closed bore magnets to 8.3{\%} (n = 3) in the open scanner (p ≤ 0.001). Anxiety during MR examination was reduced from 87.1 ± 16.7 (closed magnets) to 30.4 ± 30.8 (open magnet) (p ≤ 0.001) on visual analogue scale ranging from 0 to 100. Influence of motion artifacts on image quality was very little (inter-rater reliability r = 0.74; p {\textless} 0.01). Conclusions: MR imaging using an open 1.0 T scanner yielded a significantly decreased anxiety and subsequently an improved acceptability in claustrophobic patients compared with closed bore magnets. Motion artifacts did not influence image quality. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},
