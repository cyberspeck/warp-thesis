Successfully found a suitable solution/liquid.
Imaging sequences are ready.
Distortion assessment can be performed using the generated tool, however, it needs to be implemented on more general scale to be able to measure the distortion for all the rods automatically
    
\section{Future improvement of software tool}

The developed tool took a simplified approach to the problem by looking only at a single rod.
Future improvements should enable the software to take into account all the rods automatically.
This could be done by a autotrace function which detects individual rods and applies the already implemented algorithms to each of them separately.
